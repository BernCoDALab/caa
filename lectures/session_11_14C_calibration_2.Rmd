## Improving information gain using OxCal
### Precision

- Combine
- Wiggle Matching

### Derived information

- Summed Probability
- Duration

### Stratigraphical Modelling

- Sequential Calibration

---
## Combine

.pull-left[
- calculates the probability distribution for a specific event using multiple measurements
- goal: get a better estimation for the event by combining the dates
- is essentially similar to "measuring longer"

![](../images/11_session/r_combine_result_example.png)
]

.pull-right[
- has a strong assumption:
  - all dates actually refer to the same event
- can actually only be used if the samples have been taken from the same object
  - Measurements from several bones of the same individual
  - Measurements of several grains from one depot
- is sometimes also done, but it is questionable:
  - Measurements of bones and grains from the same grave
  - Problem: Bones accumulate the 14C signal over a longer periode and do not precisely reflect the time of death!
]

---
## Combine
### An experiment

two measurements of the same bone of an individual, died 1950 (14C) years ago

Simulation in R:

```{r}
sample1 <- rnorm(1,1950, 25)
sample1
sample2 <- rnorm(1,1950, 25)
sample2
```
---
## Combine
### An experiment

.pull-left[
The Measurements will look like this
]

.pull-right[
```{r, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
dist_range <- 1800:2100
plot(dist_range, dnorm(dist_range, mean = sample1, sd=25), type="l", ylab="Probability")
lines(dist_range, dnorm(dist_range, mean = sample2, sd=25), col="red")

quickSetupOxcal()
plot(oxcAAR::oxcalCalibrate(c(sample1, sample2), c(25,25)))
```
]

---
## Combine
### An experiment

.pull-left[
Now we combine the measurements:

$$
p_{comb} = p_1 * p_2
$$
Or more general:

$$
p_{comb} = \prod_i p_i
$$

```{r}
dist_range <- 1800:2100
comb <- dnorm(
    dist_range, mean = sample1, sd=25
    ) *
  dnorm(
    dist_range, mean = sample2, sd=25
    )
comb <- comb/sum(comb)
```
]

.pull-right[

```{r, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
plot(dist_range, dnorm(dist_range, mean = sample1, sd=25), type="l", ylim = c(0,max(comb)), ylab="Probability")
lines(dist_range, dnorm(dist_range, mean = sample2, sd=25), col="red")
lines(dist_range, comb, col="green")
```
]
---
## Combine
### An experiment

.pull-left[
And calibrate the combination:
]

.pull-right[
```{r, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
ox_script <- c(R_Date("sample1", sample1, 25),
               R_Date("sample2", sample2, 25))
ox_script <- paste0(ox_script, collapse="\n")
combine_script <- paste0('R_Combine("Combination"){', ox_script, "};")
ox_script <- ox_script <- paste0(ox_script, combine_script, collapse="\n")
my_result_file <- executeOxcalScript(ox_script)
my_result_text <- readOxcalOutput(my_result_file)
my_result_data <- parseOxcalOutput(my_result_text, only.R_Date = F)
plot(my_result_data)
```
]
---

## Combine

.pull-left[
If a single process can be more accurately dated by several dates:
- e.g. the dating of a single grave can be estimated more precisely, if more than one date of the buried person (equal to - body!) is present
- Same event - multiple dates for it
- Works without Bayes: Assumption: The dates of dating all should be equal (Bayes gets even better...)

**Attention**: Never combine if you are not sure that there are the event is actually one and the same (Simultaneity!)
]

.pull-right[

```{r, eval=FALSE}
Combine("C")
{
 R_Date("A",2000,20);
 R_Date("B",2020,30);
};
```
]
---

## Wiggle Matching

.pull-left[
If we know the (relative/absolute) temporal distance between events:
- e.g. tree rings: we know, how many years passed between individual samples
- e.g. depositional processes: we know the relative distance between samples
- Works without Bayes, but also (very well) with Bayes

**Attention**: Again, we make strong assumptions about the temporal arrangements of our samples!

## Wiggle Matching
### How it works
.pull-left[
If we have just one date, straight forward calibration:

---

## Wiggle Matching
### How it works
.pull-left[
If we have multiple dates, where we know the [absolute/relative] temporal distance, the individual calibration might not represent the best combined fit!
]

.pull-right[
![](../images/11_session/wiggle_matching_2.png)
.caption[Source: Maarten Blaauw]
]
---

## Wiggle Matching
### How it works
.pull-left[
But we can calculate the best combined fit! This reduces also the individual uncertainity of the dates!

The animation refers to a situation where we have a depositional model (not absolute distances). With tree rings, it becomes even more contraint (rigid), and by that, the amount of usable information can even be increased.

Technically: similar to the example of Bayesian calibration presented in the presence session.

## Summed Probability

.pull-left[
If we want to have a (rough) overview of the overall distribution of the data of a series of related events:
- e.g. the total use of a burial ground
- e.g. the total occupancy of a settlement
- Very simple statistics, statistical scatter of data is not taken into account

**Attention**: The OxCal manual states:

> Combining probability distributions by summing is usually difficult to justify statistically but it will generate a probability distribution which is a best estimate for the chronological distribution of the items dated (Sum). The effect of this form of combination is to average the distributions and not to decrease the error margins as with other forms of combination.

sample1
sample2

## Sum
### An experiment

.pull-left[
Now we combine the measurements using the sum:

$$
p_{sum} = p_1 + p_2
$$
Or more general:

$$
p_{sum} = \sum_i p_i
$$

```{r}
sum <- dnorm(
    dist_range, mean = sample1, sd=25
    ) +
  dnorm(
    dist_range, mean = sample2, sd=25
    )
sum <- sum/sum(sum)

## Duration/Basic Modelling

.pull-left[
If we want to have a better overview of the overall distribution of the data of a series of related events:
- e.g. the total use of a burial ground
- e.g. the total occupancy of a settlement
- We introduce Boundaries: We assume, the dates may be wrong, and the actual use phase might have started/ended somewhen around the first/last date (adding contraints)

## Duration/Basic Modelling

.pull-left[
We add some commands:

- what is sequential: **Sequence**
- what can not be sequenced: **Phase**
- what represents a border between events that belong together: **Boundary**

And some Queries:

- **Span**: How long has the total event taken place

---
## Duration/Basic Modelling

.pull-left[
We get *modelled* information -> Posterior probability distributions

- Individual dates are "compressed", because of the fact that they are assumed to belong together
- The span of the occupation can be estimated, taking into account, that the invidual dates have random (statistical) scatter

## Sequential Calibration

.pull-left[
If we have stratigraphical (sometimes also other) external information about the temporal distance between events:
- e.g. layers of an excavation, where we know the order of the dates
- sometimes, but not so reliably: typological considerations can also be incorporated
- Works only with Bayes

**Attention**: Again, we make strong assumptions about the temporal arrangements of our samples!
