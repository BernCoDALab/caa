## Types of Maps

---

## General Reference Maps

--

+ Show important physical features of an area
--

+ Include natural and man-made features
--

+ Usually meant to help aid in the navigation or discovery of locations
--

+ Usually fairly simple
--

+ Can be stylized based on the intended audience (tourists vs locals)

## Thematic Maps

--

+ Focuses on a specific theme or subject area
--

+ Features on the map represent the phenomenon being mapped
--

+ Spatial features used for reference

## GIS [1]

.pull-left[

> A geographic information system (GIS) is a system designed to capture, store, manipulate, analyze, manage, and present spatial or geographic data. - Wikipedia

]

.pull-right[
![](../images/01_session/8269791489_a6bbd062a9_o.jpg)
]
### Or more simply

> In a GIS, you connect _**data**_ with _**geography**_.
[GISgeography.com](http://gisgeography.com/what-gis-geographic-information-systems/)
---

## Geographic Information Systems (GIS)
--

+ Create interactive queries (user-created searches)
--

+ Analyze spatial information
--

+ Edit data in maps
--

+ Present the results of all these operations

## What can we do with a GIS?

![](../images/08_session/gis_functions.png)
---
## QGIS

- a free and open source GIS software
- https://www.qgis.org/
- If you not have already installed QGIS, please do now!

]
.pull-right[
![](../images/08_session/raster_vs_vector2.png)
]

## Raster (files)

--
.pull-left[
+ essentially an image with geographic information, which is georefenced
+ mostly used for background maps
+ can also contain continouus spatial information (altitude, precipitation, site density, ...)
+ Multiple formats are available (.img, .grid, .tiff, ...)
+ GeoTiffs are a quasi standard
]

.pull-right[
![:width 80%](../images/08_session/SRTM_thumb.jpg)

---
## Shapefiles
--
        
+ Basic file for storing map elements
--

+ Stores spatial data, like points, lines, and polygons
--

+ Multiple files comprise a "shapefile"

--

![img-center-80](../images/08_session/file_struct1.png)

---

## Shapefiles

![img-center-80](../images/08_session/file_struct1.png)
--

+ .shp—The main file that stores the feature geometry
--

+ .dbf—The dBASE table that stores the attribute information of features

---

## Shapefiles

![img-center-80](../images/08_session/file_struct1.png)

+ .prj—The file that stores the coordinate system information
--

+ .shx—The index file that stores the index of the feature geometry

---

## You might also see
--

+ .cpg—Identifies the character set to be used
--

+ .sbn and .sbx—The files that store the spatial index of the features

---

## Shapefiles

+ Have a few limitations
--

+ One geometry type (Point, Line, Polygon) per shapefile
--

+ So sometimes you end up with this:

## Coordinates

.pull-left[
Lat/long system measures angles on spherical surfaces

* 60º east of PM
* 55º north of equator

* Lat/long values are NOT Cartesian (X, Y) coordinates
* constant angular deviations do not have constant distance deviations
* 1° of longitude at the equator ≠ 1° of longitude near the poles

A basic Coordinate Reference System

# So what is a Coordinate Reference System?

---

## Projections
--

+ No one's favorite part of GIS
--

+ But a necessary part of it nonetheless
--

+ Convert points on the 3-dimensional Earth (**latitude** and **longitude**) to x and y coordinates on a 2-dimensional map

--

---
## Coordinate Reference Systems

.pull-left[
- Features on spherical surfaces are not easy to measure
- Features on planes are easy to measure and calculate
  - distance
  - angle
  - area
- Coordinate systems provide a measurement framework

## Coordinate Systems and Projection [2]

.pull-left[
- an imaginary light is “projected” onto a “developable surface” 
- a variety of different projection models exist
- Map projections always introduce error and distortion
]

.pull-right[
![](../images/01_session/projection_families.png)
]
---

## Projections
+ Every projection distorts some part of your map

## Projections Matter

+ These circles are all the same size on the globe:

---

## Mercator Projections
--

+ A common map projection
--

+ Makes geometries near poles look bigger than geometries near the equator
--

![:width 40%](../images/08_session/mercator.gif)

## UTM

.pull-left[
Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM)

- Based on the Transverse Mercator projection
- 60 zones (each 6° wide)
- false eastings
- Y-0 set at south pole or equator
]

.pull-right[
![](../images/08_session/utm_world.png)
]

---
## Schweizer Landeskoordinaten

.pull-left[
- a geographic coordinate system used in Switzerland for maps and surveying by the Swiss Federal Office of Topography (Swisstopo)
- The map projection used is Oblique Mercator on an 1841 Bessel ellipsoid.
- All coordinates are always positive, since Switzerland is located in the 1st quadrant of the coordinate system.
]

.pull-right[
![](../images/08_session/STP_BezugsrahmenLV95.png)
]
---
## Datums and Ellipsoids

.pull-left[
- The earth is essentially a potatoe...
- Ellipsoids are geometric estimations of the shape of the earth with more or less accurary
- a datum is a system that allows us to place a coordinate system on the earth’s surface based on a specific ellipsoid
- examples:
  - WGS84 (Lat/Lng, UTM)
  - Bessel 1841 (Schweizer Landeskoordinaten)
]

.pull-right[
![](../images/08_session/ellipsoids.png)
]
---

## Projections
+ Identified by unique IDs (**EPSG**) that make it easier to talk about them

+ EPSG: European Petroleum Survey Group Geodesy (it was introduced, because Oil companies were annoyed by the incredible number of different systems)

--
+ WGS 84 is referred to as **EPSG:4326**

--
+ Google Maps and other online sources often uses WGS 84 / Pseudo-Mercator (**EPSG:3857**)

--
+ CHTRS95 is referred to as **EPSG:2056**

--

## Remember these three and you should be set

---
## Georeferencing
.pull-left[
The process of orienting a image in geographical space

* Every map comes with its own projection. Sometimes known, more often not

* Every mapping results in errors or imprecision. Every digitalisation adds errors up to that.

* Scale matters: digitised information on large scale might be precise enough, on small scale not. It is necessary to keep meta-data to know how the data were digitised (on what scale) to be able to understand on what scale they might be used.

---
## Digitising

.pull-left[
The process of attaching geocoordinates to points on georeferenced maps

Rather straight forward:

* You have a layer of a certain geometry
* You make it editable
* You click on the feature of the scanned map
* You specify additional information for that point
* Rinse and repeat
* Finally, save the layer
